```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We can use dplyr to try to find the average admitance depending on school rank, first for ease of view in the window we can turn this into a dplry table 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
getwd()
library(dplyr)
Admit <- read.csv("LogReg.csv")
head(Admit)
#The code below makes a dplyr table or dataframe which allows us to do all sorts of quick data manipulation
admit_df <- tbl_df(Admit)
admit_df
```

Next let's do some filtering to see who is getting admited
```{r, echo=TRUE}
#Below we can filter just on those that have been admitted
admit_df_rank1 <- filter(admit_df, admit==1)
View(admit_df_rank1)
summary(admit_df_rank1)
admit_df_rank2 <- filter(admit_df, admit==0)
summary(admit_df_rank2)
fix(admit_df_rank1)
```

We can also try some grouping and then arrange by rank
```{r, echo=TRUE}
rank_group <- group_by(admit_df, rank)
rank_group
summarise(rank_group, mean(gre), mean(gpa))
rank_group.a <- arrange(rank_group, desc(rank))

```

Ok now that we have the grouping and sorting we want we can start to do some additional summary stats, below gives us the average admits from each rank by creating a new variable showing the average number of admitance from each rank

```{r, echo=TRUE}
rank_admits <- summarize(rank_group, count=n(), average=mean(admit))
#So we can see that admitance rate for those in rank 1 is more than double rank 3 and triple that of rank 4
rank_admits
```

We can also do the sum to get the numbers being admitted
```{r, echo=TRUE}
rank_admits.1 <- summarize(rank_group, count=n(), admits=sum(admit))
rank_admits.1
```
Now let's focus on the ISLR data

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
#Let's load the package and library
install.packages("ISLR")
library(ISLR)
library(doBy)
#Even though its already in a tight structure is good to make a data.frame
x <- data.frame(Auto)
# Ok now we know something about the dataset. The question we are trying to answer is what is the average MPG, by year and cylinder size?
ave_mpg_year_cyl <- summaryBy(mpg~year+cylinders, data = x)
head(ave_mpg_year_cyl)
```
Homework with DPLYR
```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
ave_mpg_yrcyl <- data.frame(Auto)
ave_mpg_yrcyl %<>%
  group_by(year, cylinders) %>%
  summarise (avgmpg= mean(mpg))
head(ave_mpg)
```

```{r}


```
