Simple example of subset data we've used previously, just indicate where we want to target using the subset feature
```{r}
#plot first to take a look at the data
str(cars)
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist, main = "Cars Plot", xlab="Speed", ylab="Distance")
#can add a line as well
scatter.smooth(cars)
#Look at some initial desc stats
library(pastecs)
 stat.desc(cars)
#Looks like we have a linear line
# Go ahead a develop our model
# Does Speed effect stoping distance?
x <- lm(dist~speed, data = cars)
head(cars)
summary(x)
speed.s <- scale(cars$speed, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)
#Here we are focusing on cars with speed greater than 15mph
x1 <- lm(dist~speed,data = subset(cars,speed>15))
summary(x1)
```

However once we get up to a significant number of variables and we want to know which most explain the variance in our dependent variable. 
```{r}
library(leaps)
library(ISLR)
#This is essentially best fit 
View(Hitters)
reg.best <- regsubsets(Salary~., data = Hitters, nvmax = 19)
#The plot will show the Adjust R^2 when using the variables across the bottom
plot(reg.best, scale = "adjr2", main = "Adjusted R^2")
summary(reg.best)

#We can also go backward and see if our results are any different
reg.back <- regsubsets(Salary~., data = Hitters, method = "backward", nvmax = 20)
#The plot will show the Adjust R^2 when using the variables across the bottom
plot(reg.back, scale = "adjr2", main = "Adjusted R^2")
summary(reg.back)

#We can also be forward selection
reg.forward <- regsubsets(Salary~., data = Hitters, nvmax = 7, nbest = 1, method = "forward")
summary(reg.forward)
#Maybe we try with even less variables 
plot(reg.forward, scale = "adjr2", main = "Adjusted R^2")
reg.forward
#Lastly we can do the hybrid approach
reg.seqrep <- regsubsets(Salary~., data = Hitters,nvmax = 7, nbest = 1, method = "seqrep")
plot(reg.seqrep, scale = "adjr2", main = "Adjusted R^2")
#Here we want the hieghest Adjusted R^2 which looks to be .5, then looking across the .5 row wherever we see a black box is a recommended variable to use. 
#Looks like pretty much the same variables, we can also do Cp as discussed in the slides
plot(reg.seqrep, scale = "Cp", main = "Cp")
#Here it looks like we are again selecting pretty much the same variables, by using the lowest Cp 
summary(reg.seqrep)
```

```{r}


```
