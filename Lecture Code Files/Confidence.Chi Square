```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
basehwa <- data.frame(read.csv("BaseballHeightWeight.csv", header = TRUE))
str(basehwa)
head(basehwa)
height <- basehwa$Height.inches.
weight <- basehwa$Weight.pounds.
sd.height <- sd(height)
mean.height <- mean(height)
sd.weight <- sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE)
mean.weight <- mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)
mean.weight
sd.weight

```
Z scores
```{r}
z <- (80-mean.height)/sd.height
z

# No that we have a z score we could look it up on a table or use R to calculate the percentage, pnorm tells us the percentage.
pnorm(z)
pnorm(2.73)
```

So we could also do confidence intervals, we need the standard error, mean and n for height, qnorm essential gives us our z-score
```{r, echo=TRUE}
qnorm(.975)

n <- length(height)
n
std.error <- qnorm(.975)*sd.height/sqrt(n)
std.error
lower.limit <- mean.height-std.error
upper.limit <- mean.height+std.error
lower.limit
  upper.limit

```

Confidence Intervals t.test
```{r}
t.test(height)
```
Scaled variables, generating z-scores
```{r}
#Allows variables to speak the same language and be interpreted as such. 
describe(weight)
describe(height)
hist(weight)
hist(height)
weight.scaled <- scale(weight)
height.scaled <- scale(height)
hist(weight.scaled)
hist(height.scaled)
describe(weight.scaled)
```
Chi-Square Example
```{r}
library(vcd)
str(Arthritis)
#We can see from the summary that we have several factor (categorical) level and one ordered factor (ordinal) 
# So if we want to run a test of indendence and Chi Square is perfect, 
#Trying to determine if Treatment and Improved are independent 
#We will set the signifance level at .05 and generate a test statistic
chisq.test(Arthritis$Treatment,Arthritis$Improved)
# Results show us that p value is less than .05 meaning our test is significant
#You can also create a table first, some people like to do this because it makes certain steps more visable, such percentages in the categories and totals
tbl <- table(Arthritis$Treatment, Arthritis$Improved)
#The results should be the same. 
tbl

cxtbl <-  chisq.test(tbl)

cxtbl$residuals
cxtbl$observed
cxtbl$expected
#By looking at the expected and observed and residuals we can see that the observed are different than the expected, residuals equal (observed - expected) / sqrt(expected)
```
